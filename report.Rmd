## Dataset

This project will use publicly available county-level COVID-19 data to investigate the relationship between population factors (e.g., age, race and ethnicity, population density), socioeconomic status (e.g., education, poverty, GINI index, employment), health care access (e.g., insurance, urbanicitiy, crude mortality), and COVID-19 mortality. 

Weekly data on per capita COVID-19 mortality in each county was downloaded from the New York Times. Data on county-level population age distribution was pulled from CDC Vintage 2020 Bridged-Race Postcensal Population Estimates. Data on county level factors was obtained from US Census 2017-2021 American Community Survey, USDA, and National Center for Health Statistics Mortality Data on CDC WONDER (2019 crude mortality rates).
