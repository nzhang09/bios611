# Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused more than 1.2 million confirmed deaths in the United States as of November 2024. According to the COVID-19 case counts between January 2020 to March 2023, the county-level COVID-19 death rates are not evenly distributed across the country, ranging from the lowest death rate of 11.5 deaths/100k population to the highest of 1370.7 deaths/100k population (Figure 1). To explore predictors of the COVID-19 mortality rate, this project used linear regression, LASSO, and elastic net machine learning methods to select impactful predictors among county-level demographics. The report first introduces data sources and data cleaning, followed by description of the statistical methods and key results, and ends with discussing the public health implications and limitations.

# Data source

## Outcome

Outcome of this project is the county-level COVID-19 death rate between January 2020 to March 2023. Publicly available death counts were downloaded from the New York Times COVID-19 data repository (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us-counties-2023.csv), which included 3,036 counties. Death rate for each county was calculated by dividing the total number of deaths over the county population.

## Covariates

County-level age distribution data was downloaded from CDC, which includes the proportions of each 5-year age group. The mean age for each county was calculated, by weighting the middle point of each age group by the population in that age group. County-level pre-COVID mortality rate was pulled from the National Center for Health Statistics Mortality Data on CDC WONDER, to capture the pre-pandemic health situation. Demographics data were pulled from the US Census 2017-2021 American Community Survey using the R `tidycensus` package. Covariates include population structure factors (population density, population identifying as White/Black/Asian/Hispanic or Latino), household factors (total number of households, proportion of married households, proportion of households which needs public assistance, median household income), socioeconomic factors (population without health insurance, population with income below the poverty level, population receiving high school education, GINI index).


#Methods

The correlation matrix between the death rates and all covariates were generated to understand the univariate association between the outcome and potential predictors. Covariates with low correlation coefficients with the outcome were removed from the analysis. Since the outcome is continuous, linear regression was first applied to identify significant predictors. LASSO and Elastic Net with 10-fold cross validation were also conducted to perform variable selection and regularization. Coefficient estimates, predictions, and model residuals from three method were presented.

#Results

From the correlation matrix (Figure 2), death rate (`deaths_per_100k`) has low correlations with the proportion of White population (`white`), the proportion of Hispanic/Latino population (`hispaniclatino`), and the proportion of households which requires public assistance (`pubassishh`). Given that population disparities is an important factor in public health research, `white` and `hispaniclatino` were retained in the modeling process and `pubassishh` was removed from further analysis.

```

Based on the modeling results, age, proportion of Asian population, median household income, pre-COVID death rate, proportion of population with no health insurance, and proportion of population receiving high school education were significant in all three models. Proportion of Hispanic/Latino population and proportion of married households were significant in the linear regression and elastic net, but were regulated to 0 in LASSO. Three models had similar performance w.r.t. mean squared error and residuals (Figures 3-5).
